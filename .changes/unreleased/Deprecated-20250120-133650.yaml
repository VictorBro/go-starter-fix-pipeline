kind: Deprecated
body: 'Deprecated the mailer option UseTLS (`SERVER_SMTP_USE_TLS`) in favour of Encryption (`SERVER_SMTP_ENCRYPTION`). If you were using the `SERVER_SMTP_USE_TLS` flag before to enable TLS, you will need to migrate to the `SERVER_SMTP_ENCRYPTION` setting of `tls`. For the moment, both settings are supported (with a warning being printed when using `SERVER_SMTP_USE_TLS`, however support for the deprecated config will be dropped in one of the next releases. See [Mailer UseTLS SERVER_SMTP_USE_TLS Deprecation](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/wiki/Mailer-UseTLS-SERVER_SMTP_USE_TLS-Deprecation)'
